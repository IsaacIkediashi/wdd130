  <h1> My favorite city</h1>
  <p>The name of my favorite city is Ikorodu, is located in the north-east of lagos where I live in, 
    it shares a boundary with Ogun state. With a population of over 1 million inhabitants, Ikorodu is currently the 12th largest city in Nigeria and growing at a rate of 5.26% annually, 
    it is projected to reach 1.7 million inhabitants by 2035.</p>
    <p>
      It is the 2nd largest local government in Lagos State.
      Indigenous settlers of Ikorodu emigrated from Sagamu and part of Ijebu in Ogun state.
