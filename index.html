        <h2>Delta</h2>
        <img src="../wdd130/images/state.jpg" alt="Delta State">
        <p>Delta State was defined out of the former Bendel State on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following 
           agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.
           Delta State covers a landmass of about 18,050 km2 (6,970 mi2), of which more than 60% is land.
           The state lies approximately between 5°00' and 6°45' E and 5°00' and 6°30' N. It is geographically located in Nigeria's Midwest, bounded in the north and west by Edo State for 350 km (218 miles), 
           the east by Anambra, and Rivers States for about 93 km and about 50 km respectively, southeast by Bayelsa State across the Niger River for 17 km and the Forçados River for 198 km, and on the southern extreme is the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without any remarkable hills. 
           The state has a wide coastal belt inter-laced with rivulets and streams, which form part of the Niger Delta.</p>
