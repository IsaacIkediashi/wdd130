    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="history">
    <p>Founded in 2005, Great Waterways began as a small local rafting company with just one guide and a single raft.
     Over the years, it has grown into a premier whitewater rafting company, serving thousands of thrill-seekers each year.
     Committed to unforgettable experiences.</p>
    <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Great Waterways History">
    <p>Great Waterways was founded out of a passion for adventure and a deep respect
     for the natural rivers that shape our world. Inspired by the early explorers
     who first navigated wild waterways in the 19th century, our company carries
     forward the spirit of discovery and teamwork that defines white water rafting.
